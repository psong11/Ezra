# Google Cloud Credentials Setup for Vercel

## üéØ Problem
Your app works locally using Application Default Credentials (ADC) from gcloud CLI, but Vercel doesn't have gcloud installed. We need to explicitly provide Google Cloud credentials via environment variable.

## üìã Complete Setup Guide

### **Phase 1: Create Google Cloud Service Account**

#### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console
Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/

#### Step 2: Select or Create Project
- If you already have a project, select it
- If not, click "Create Project" and give it a name (e.g., "ezra-app")

#### Step 3: Enable Text-to-Speech API
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/texttospeech.googleapis.com
2. Click **"Enable"** button
3. Wait for it to enable (takes a few seconds)

#### Step 4: Create Service Account
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
2. Click **"+ Create Service Account"** at the top
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Service account name:** `ezra-tts-service`
   - **Service account ID:** (auto-filled: `ezra-tts-service`)
   - **Description:** `Service account for Ezra app TTS on Vercel`
4. Click **"Create and Continue"**

#### Step 5: Grant Permissions
1. In "Grant this service account access to project":
   - Click the "Select a role" dropdown
   - Search for: `Cloud Text-to-Speech API User`
   - Select: **"Cloud Text-to-Speech API User"**
2. Click **"Continue"**
3. Skip "Grant users access to this service account" (optional)
4. Click **"Done"**

#### Step 6: Create and Download JSON Key
1. You'll see your service account in the list
2. Click on the service account email (e.g., `ezra-tts-service@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
3. Go to the **"Keys"** tab
4. Click **"Add Key"** ‚Üí **"Create new key"**
5. Select format: **"JSON"**
6. Click **"Create"**
7. A JSON file will automatically download to your computer
   - Filename will be like: `your-project-name-xxxxx.json`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This file contains secrets! Keep it secure and never commit it to GitHub.

---

### **Phase 2: Add Credentials to Vercel**

#### Step 1: Open the Downloaded JSON File
1. Find the downloaded JSON file in your Downloads folder
2. Open it with a text editor (TextEdit, VS Code, etc.)
3. The content should look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "abc123...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIE...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "ezra-tts-service@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "123456789",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/..."
}
```

#### Step 2: Copy the Entire JSON Content
- Select **ALL** the text (Cmd+A on Mac, Ctrl+A on Windows)
- Copy it (Cmd+C on Mac, Ctrl+C on Windows)
- Make sure you got the entire thing, including opening and closing curly braces `{ }`

#### Step 3: Add to Vercel
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/psong11s-projects/ezra/settings/environment-variables
2. Click the **"Add New"** button
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name:** `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
   - **Value:** Paste the entire JSON content you copied
   - **Environments:** Check ALL three boxes:
     - ‚úÖ Production
     - ‚úÖ Preview  
     - ‚úÖ Development
4. Click **"Save"**

You should see a success message!

#### Step 4: Verify Environment Variable Was Added
- You should now see `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` in the list
- It should show "All" under Environments
- The value will be hidden (shows as dots `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢`)

---

### **Phase 3: Redeploy to Vercel**

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment
Vercel will automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Manual Deployment (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
vercel --prod
```

This will:
1. Upload your latest code
2. Use the new environment variable
3. Deploy to production
4. Give you a URL to test

---

### **Phase 4: Test the Deployment**

#### Step 1: Wait for Build to Complete
- Watch the terminal for "‚úÖ Production: https://ezra-..." message
- Or check: https://vercel.com/psong11s-projects/ezra

#### Step 2: Test on Your Phone
1. Open Safari/Chrome on your phone
2. Go to: **https://ezra-zeta.vercel.app**
3. Navigate to: Genesis ‚Üí Chapter 1
4. Click on a verse number to play audio
5. It should work now! üéâ

#### Step 3: Check Logs if It Still Fails
```bash
vercel logs ezra-zeta.vercel.app --follow
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "üîë Using Google credentials from JSON environment variable"
- ‚ùå "Failed to initialize Google TTS Client"
- ‚ùå "Invalid Google credentials JSON"

---

### **Phase 5: (Optional) Add Credentials Locally**

If you want your local environment to match production exactly:

1. Open `.env.local` in your project
2. Add this line:
```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON={"type":"service_account",...PASTE_ENTIRE_JSON_HERE...}
```

3. Make sure it's a single line (no line breaks)

**OR** keep using ADC (what you're doing now):
- Your local setup will continue using gcloud credentials
- Production will use the service account JSON
- Both will work!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to parse GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON"
**Solution:** Make sure you copied the entire JSON, including `{ }` braces

### Issue: "Permission denied" or "403 Forbidden"
**Solution:** 
1. Check service account has "Cloud Text-to-Speech API User" role
2. Make sure Text-to-Speech API is enabled in your project

### Issue: Still getting 500 error after deployment
**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs ezra-zeta.vercel.app`
2. Make sure you redeployed AFTER adding the env var
3. Verify env var is set: Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

### Issue: Works locally but not on Vercel
**Solution:**
1. Your local setup uses ADC (gcloud credentials)
2. Vercel needs explicit credentials in environment variable
3. Make sure you completed all steps above

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before testing:
- [ ] Text-to-Speech API is enabled in Google Cloud
- [ ] Service account created with proper permissions
- [ ] JSON key downloaded
- [ ] `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` added to Vercel
- [ ] All three environments checked (Production, Preview, Development)
- [ ] Redeployed to Vercel after adding env var
- [ ] Waited for build to complete (check Vercel dashboard)

## üìä How Credentials Work

### Local Development (Your Computer)
```
You run: npm run dev
‚Üì
App uses: Application Default Credentials (ADC)
‚Üì
ADC finds: gcloud CLI credentials on your Mac
‚Üì
Result: Works! ‚úÖ
```

### Production (Vercel)
```
User visits: ezra-zeta.vercel.app
‚Üì
Vercel runs: Your app on their servers
‚Üì
No gcloud CLI ‚Üí ADC fails ‚ùå
‚Üì
Solution: Read GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON
‚Üì
Parse JSON ‚Üí Create credentials object
‚Üì
Pass to Google TTS client
‚Üì
Result: Works! ‚úÖ
```

### Three Ways to Authenticate

| Method | Where | Priority | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| **JSON string** | `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` | 1 (Highest) | Vercel, production |
| **File path** | `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | 2 | Local with service account |
| **ADC** | gcloud CLI | 3 (Fallback) | Local development |

Our code checks in this order:
1. Is `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` set? Use that.
2. Is `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` set? Use that file.
3. Neither set? Fall back to ADC (gcloud).

## üîí Security Notes

### DO:
‚úÖ Add credentials to Vercel environment variables  
‚úÖ Keep the JSON file secure on your computer  
‚úÖ Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` (already done)  
‚úÖ Rotate credentials periodically  

### DON'T:
‚ùå Commit credentials to GitHub  
‚ùå Share credentials publicly  
‚ùå Use personal credentials for production  
‚ùå Email or message credentials  

### If Credentials Are Compromised:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Delete the compromised service account key
3. Create a new key
4. Update Vercel environment variable
5. Redeploy
