## üí¨ Conversation Context

**What We Built:**
- A modern Next.js poetry website called "Ezra"
- 33 original poems in different languages (shortened to ~30 words each)
- Complete Google Cloud Text-to-Speech integration
- Professional-grade caching, error handling, and testing

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Used Next.js App Router (not Pages Router)
- Server-side API routes for TTS to keep credentials secure
- Two-tier caching (LRU memory + disk storage)
- Graceful degradation (website works without TTS)
- RTL language support for Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu

**Last Working On:**
- Debugging authentication errors
- Adding helpful error messages for missing credentials
- Corporate computer blocked Google Cloud SDK installation

## üìû How to Continue This Chat

### Option A: Reference This File
When you open VS Code on your personal computer:
1. Open the Ezra project folder
2. Read this file (`CONTINUATION.md`)
3. Tell Copilot: "I'm continuing the Ezra project. Read CONTINUATION.md for context."

### Option B: Quick Catch-Up Prompt
Copy-paste this into Copilot Chat:

```
I'm continuing work on the "Ezra" multilingual poetry website. 
It's a Next.js app with Google Cloud TTS integration.

Current status:
- All code is complete and committed to git
- Need to set up Google Cloud authentication
- TTS shows helpful setup messages when not authenticated

What I need help with:
1. Pushing to GitHub (if not done)
2. Setting up Google Cloud SDK
3. Testing the TTS functionality
```
